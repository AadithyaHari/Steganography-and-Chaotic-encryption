# Image Steganography

Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within a larger one in such a way that someone can not know the presence or contents of the hidden message.

The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties. Unlike cryptography, which conceals the contents of a secret message, steganography conceals the very fact that a message is communicated. 
 
Although steganography differs from cryptography, there are many analogies between the two, and some authors classify steganography as a form of cryptography since hidden communication is a type of secret message


## Technologies Used
```
1. Open CV

2. Least Significant Bit Steganography

3. Python
```

## Advantage Over Cryptography

The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. 

Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.

## To Run

Run the Image Steganography.ipynb file and in the place of image choose the image you want to choose..

Then run the encode_data function to encode the desired data.

After encoding the data run the decode_data function to decode the encoded data.

### Result

These were the images before and after encoding the data.

#### Original Image-

<img src ="origimage.PNG"  width=800 height=500>
<br>


#### Image after Encoding the data-

<img src ="Imagefinal.PNG"  width=800 height=530>
<br>
